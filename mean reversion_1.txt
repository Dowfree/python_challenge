Our models assume that all booths are identical. However, systems such as E-ZPass allow a driver to pay a toll electronically from an in-car device without stopping at a tollbooth. If all E-ZPass booths also double as regular telleroperated booths, much of our models remain the same, except that the average service rate might increase. The trouble comes when all the booths are not the same and drivers may need to change lanes upon entering the plaza. This directed lane changing was not implemented in any of the models presented here, but could easily become a part of the automata model. Exclusive E-ZPass booths also would drastically reduce the operating cost for the booth, since an operator's salarywould not need to be paid (from $16,000 to $180,000 annually) [Sullivan 1994].
